Code implements Pseudo Random Function using PRG(Pseudo Random Generator)
As per definition:
        Fk(x1,x2,..xn) = Gxn(Gxn-1(..(Gx1(k))))
        where k is seed and x1,x2..,xn is the binary represenation of message.

        G0(k) is the first half of string generated by PRG taking k as input.
        G1(k) is the second half of string generated by PRG taking k as input.
        And the expansion factor of PRG here is l(n)=2n.

Take the seed and random message bits as input.

Algorithm:
Passing k in PRG and obtain a bit string. According to value of x1, take the first or second half of the string and pass on it as seed to Gx2. 
Continue doing it till you read all message bits.
The final string so generated is used as an encryption-decryption key.
