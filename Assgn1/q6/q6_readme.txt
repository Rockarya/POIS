Building fixed length collision resistant hash fucntion taking DLP assumption.

Take input n,x1,x2.

Algorithm:
We will take input as n and will take n bit prime number from the dictionary
Generate a cyclic group G, by taking generator g and modulus p.
q = # of elements in G
h = random element in G
Hash function H(x1,x2) = ((g^x1)%p * (h^x2)%p)%p
The length of bit string generated by hash function will be n.
